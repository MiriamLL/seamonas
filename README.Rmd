**seamonas** provides easy access to information based on guidelines for monitoring seabirds at sea. 
It includes detailed table content and a sample dataset to support implementation.
Information based on the HELCOM Monitoring Guidelines for Seabirds at Sea [ESAS database](https://helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HELCOM-Monitoring-guidelines-for-seabirds-at-sea-monitoring.pdf).

## About

**seamonas** contains:

- A **list of 549 species** across morphological separated groups.
- Harmonized **column names** and guidance for completing each entry.
- Unified **descriptions** for field entries, includes abiotic structures, activity codes, associations.
- One **trip example** from a monitoring containing basic trip information.  
- One **survey example** from a monitoring containing survey information. 
- One survey example from a monitoring containing **species detected and specifications**. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of seamonas from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/seamonas")
```

## Start

Load the package

```{r}
library(seamonas)
```

## Euring

`seamonas` contains:  
- A list of **549** species names across morphological separated groups.

```{r}
head(Code_Euring)
```

**Key fields**: 

- `Code`: Numerical code based on [Euring](https://euring.org/data-and-codes/euring-codes). The species codes are primarily based on the EURING list, with additional 'uncertainty codes' commonly used by ESAS partners to represent species groups that are often difficult to identify under at-sea field conditions.<br>
